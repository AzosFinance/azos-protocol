# ❱ Settlement

The Settlement Module serves as a critical component in the lifecycle of the HAI protocol, governing its shutdown and the subsequent redemption of HAI tokens for underlying collateral. It activates in circumstances that necessitate the halting of the system—such as critical bugs, governance decisions, or market anomalies—to ensure a smooth and orderly unwinding of positions. The module's primary objective is to provide a transparent and fair mechanism for redeeming HAI tokens, thereby ensuring the protocol's integrity even in its termination phase.
