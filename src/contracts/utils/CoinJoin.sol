    Here we provide CoinJoin adapter (for connecting internal coin balances) 
    to connect the SAFEEngine to arbitrary external token implementations, 
    creating a bounded context for the SAFEEngine.
    In practice, adapter implementations will be varied and specific to
    individual collateral types, accounting for different transfer
    semantics and token standards.
    Adapters need to implement two basic methods:
      - `join`: enter collateral into the system
      - `exit`: remove collateral from the system
